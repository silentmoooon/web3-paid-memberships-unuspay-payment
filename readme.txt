== Description ==

üî•Leverage the innovation of blockchain and crypto technology with Aurpay to earn $2 more per order compared to other solutions. <strong>Imagine 1,000 orders, and you could generate an additional $2,000 in revenue** through Aurpay.</strong>


üîêAurpay's **Smart Contract** ensures decentralization and security for user assets. <strong>We are the only true non-custodial solution provider. No competitors can match us.</strong> Only you can access your assets ‚Äì not us, and not anyone else.


### For example:

On Coinbase, if a merchant has 1,000 ERC20 crypto orders, they would pay 1,000 times more in gas fees according to Coinbase's model. Each time it costs $2, leading to a loss of $2,000. It's impossible for Coinbase to subsidize merchants indefinitely.

With Aurpay, you only need to pay one gas fee for 1,000 orders or more, costing just $2. Invisibly, Aurpay generates significant profits for you. <strong>Every time you receive our ERC20 tokens, you earn $2</strong>. We genuinely care about your success ‚Äì we make money only when you make money. It's that simple!
